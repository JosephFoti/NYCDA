Promise States,
pending - waiting for call fulfilled/rejected
fulfilled - settled and confirmed;
rejected - settled and not confirmed

var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
	//perform action
	//this could be any synchronous or asynchronous operation

	// if error
	reject(errorFunction);

	//if everything went well;
	resolve(result);
	// Store your data into a var
})

promise instance then calls function on successful result, used to parse the prev. stored data.

[promiseInstance].then(
	//do something with your data
);
