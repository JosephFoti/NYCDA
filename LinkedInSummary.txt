My Name is Joseph Foti and, due to a series of serendipitous events, I am a Web-Developer/Web-Designer with experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node JS, Swift, and PostgreSQL. I also have experience using content management sites such as Wordpress, SquareSpace and Wix.

I am passionate about tasks that are both logically and creatively challenging. I consider myself an artisan, and my code and design my craft. I have strong interpersonal skills, I make friends easily and I have always maintained strong working relationships with my peers. I take the quality of my work seriously, and I respect people who feel the same way. I'm eager to learn from my peers, and a quick study. 

I'm a proud manhattanite, born and raised on the same street that my grandparents and great-grandparents lived. I'm a story-telling addict; Television, Movies, Books, Podcasts and Video-games all intrigue me. I also enjoy drawing, playing bass guitar, photography and board games with friends.
